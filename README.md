# Hearts and Paws

## Development Workflow

Before implementing a new feature, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**

   - Always create a new branch from `dev` before starting any new feature.
   - Use the following commands:
     ```sh
     git checkout dev
     git pull origin dev
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```

2. **Implement Your Changes**

   - Work on your feature in the new branch.
   - Make sure to test your changes locally.

3. **Commit and Push**

   - Once done, commit your changes:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Implemented new feature"
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

   - Open a PR to merge your changes into `dev`.
   - Add a meaningful description of the changes.
   - Request reviews from the team.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd hearts-and-paws
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Prisma and Database**

   - Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
   - Set up your environment variables in `.env`:
     ```sh
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
     ```
   - Run Prisma commands to set up the database:
     ```sh
     npx prisma migrate dev --name init
     npx prisma generate
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   The project should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Notes

- Always pull the latest changes from `dev` before starting a new feature.
- Ensure all code follows the project's linting and formatting rules.
- Run Prisma migrations when modifying the database schema.
- Write meaningful commit messages and PR descriptions.
